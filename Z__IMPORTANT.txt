 --------------  IMPORTANT NOTES TO READ  --------------

 I used composer autoload script along with classmap standard, so that every php web page will be created need to require
 the autoload in composer vendor directory.
 init.php file include configurations and it's also needed along with autoload in every page deals with configurations

 Hint:
 functions/sanitize.php file could not be included by adding the following statement inside init.php: 
    require_once functions/sanitize.php
because this will be available only in root directory and because index.php is in the root directory, it will work fine, but if we include our
init.php file in a different position in directory system it will generate a Fatal error because functions/sanitize.php is 
relative to root directory. SO we need to include it also with autoload and init file if the calling script needs it.

[IMPORTANT]: When you add a class and attach it to a namespace, don't forgtet to update composer so it could used
it in classmap array

[IMPORTANT]: When you get an error don't be hurry to look at the solution, most of the times the solution is there, you
ONLY NEED TO READ THE ERROR CLOSELY AND CAREFULLY
